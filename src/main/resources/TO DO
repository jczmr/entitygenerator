TO DO

- Separate in the GenerateEntity class, the getJavaDataTypeFromOracleDataType method, to consider more than a single database data type.
- Doesn't generate properly camel case names, when column names, are compound words. Now is working with words separated by underscore. 
- Instead of reading data from a file, try getting the table's metadata directly through a database connection.
- Check for Data types that map to database data types in Java applications that use JDBC for the required Database. 
  This example use Oracle 11g mapping as reference based on https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/java.112/e10587/datamap.htm#JJPUB24092
